# react-component-toolkit

1. You will need to change the story to use a valid endpoint and search term, edit file src/Graphikle/stories.tsx - line 37 and 38 - I'll email you a working endpoint and search term you can test against (technically you can use any search term it will always return something)
2. npm install
3. npm run build
4. npm test
5. npm run ladle:prod - runs the component in a runtime test harness in production mode.

NOTES:

1. Execute npm run to see more things you can do.
2. Open the debugger in your browser and display console to see realtime logging of events in the control window (click, right click on background, node and links will display an alert, everything else browser console.logged)
